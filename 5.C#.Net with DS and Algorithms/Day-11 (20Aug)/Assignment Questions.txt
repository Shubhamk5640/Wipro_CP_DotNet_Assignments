1) Create a CustomStack class in C# with operations Push, Pop, Peek, and IsEmpty.
   Demonstrate its LIFO behavior by pushing integers onto the stack, then popping 
   and displaying them until the stack is empty.
   Create with employee class-Name,Gender,ContactNo for stack operation.

2) Develop a CustomQueue class with methods for Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek, and IsEmpty.
   Show how your queue can handle different data types by enqueuing strings and integers,
   then dequeuing and displaying them to confirm FIFO order.
   Create with employee class-Name,Gender,ContactNo for queue operation.
